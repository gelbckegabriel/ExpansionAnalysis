  <h2>Project Scenario:</h2>
  <p>
    An international firm that is looking to expand its business in different countries across the world has recruited me. I have been hired as a junior Data Engineer and I’m
    tasked with creating an automated script that can extract the list of all countries in order of their GDPs in billion USDs (rounded to 2 decimal places), as logged by the
    International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since IMF releases this evaluation twice a year, this code will be used by the organization to extract the information as it is updated.
    <br><br>
    You can find the required data on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230902185326/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29" target="_blank">this
      wikipedia webpage</a>.
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>The required information needs to be made accessible as a JSON file 'Countries_by_GDP.json' as well as a table 'Countries_by_GDP' in a database file 'World_Economies.db'
        with attributes 'Country' and 'GDP_USD_billion.'</li>
      <li>Your boss wants you to demonstrate the success of this code by running a query on the database table to display only the entries with more than a 100 billion USD economy.
        Also, log the entire process of execution in a file named 'etl_project_log.txt'.</li>
      <li>You must create a Python code 'etl_project_gdp.py' that performs all the required tasks.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Objective:</h2>
  <p>
    Design marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.
  </p>

  <br>

  <h2>My Mission:</h2>
  <p>
  As a junior data analyst for Cyclistic, my mission is to delve into the Cyclistic historical bike trip data, uncover trends, and understand the story from our clients. Through this, I aim to develop a strategy that effectively converts casual users into loyal annual members, contributing to Cyclistic's continued success.

  Feel free to explore the R branch for data processing, the Tableau branch for visualizations, and the Presentation branch for a detailed overview of the project solution.
